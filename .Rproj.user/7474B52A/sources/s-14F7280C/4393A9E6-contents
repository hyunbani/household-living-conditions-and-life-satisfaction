abstract: "This report describes the results of research on the effects of household living conditions on life satisfaction. It is found that better housing conditions do improve life satisfaction to a certain degree. These results are important as it is fundamental that people know what makes them satisfied with their lives because no human would wish to have an unsatisfying life."
