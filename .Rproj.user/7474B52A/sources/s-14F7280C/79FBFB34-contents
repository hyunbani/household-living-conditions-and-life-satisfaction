#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: In this file we are interested in using some data from a survey about 
# name change after marriage that was conducted in 2019 by Phillip Cohen. We want 
# to clean the data to prepare it for regression analysis.
# Name: Rohan Alexander
# Date: 8 October 2020
# Pre-reqs: Need to have downloaded the data from: https://osf.io/8n9se/. That 
# dataset is available in the inputs folder.


#### Workspace set-up ####
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)

raw_data <- read_dta('inputs/MNCS-PV2.dta')
